🔁 Josephus Problem in C

This repository contains a C language implementation of the classic **Josephus Problem** — a theoretical puzzle related to a certain elimination process that forms the basis of circular linked list problems and recursion-based solutions in computer science.

🧩 Problem Overview

In the Josephus Problem, people stand in a circle and are eliminated every k-th person until only one remains. The goal is to determine the safe position (the survivor) given the number of people `n` and a step count `k`.

📘 Key Concepts

* Recursive and/or iterative approach to solve the Josephus problem
* Circular linked list (optional version)
* Control flow and logical reasoning
* Application of mathematical recurrence relations in C

🛠️ Features

* Clean and well-commented C code
* Supports dynamic input for number of people and step size
* Includes both basic and optimized solutions
* Great for practicing recursion and logic building
